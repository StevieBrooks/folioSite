                <h1 class="main-title">Coding Anxiety: Delightful Tips To Beat It</h1>
            </div>
            <p class="open-para">When I was 13, I called up a girl that I had a crush on. Her ruthless stepdad answered, called me names and advised me to leave his little girl alone. Needless to say, I felt broken and miserable; my confidence was in the shitter. I suspect that everyone has felt the same way about coding too. Punching in those lines of code that are gonna change the world, then the bugs come and ruin it. Coding anxiety kicks in and you feel like throwing your laptop in front of a bus.</p>
            <p>I started on HTML and CSS and thought the latter was difficult enough. I’ve lost count of situations when flexbox feels as flexible as a brick wall. And that darn position property already has a way of making me feel out of place.  Albeit, compared to Javascript, all of these markup languages feel like child's play. At least with CSS, there’s often a visual representation of the stuff you’re coding. All I’ve been getting from Javascript is “The computer says, no!”</p>
            <p>So what’s a wannabe computer nerd to do when their command of the keys is less than inspiring? Should I take a break or throw in the towel completely? At times like this, one of those blow-up sex dolls would be useful, just so I could strangle it. An earthquake’s intensity is measured with the Richter scale. Coding anxiety should have a scale of its own. I would base it on the amount of laptop screens I’ve punched. As it happens, I’m less juvenile these days, albeit, that doesn’t stop me from fantasizing.</p>
            <p>Despite the relentless agony associated with coding anxiety, there are a multitude of coping methods. Throughout this rant, I’m going to delve into some of my personal choices. I’m not claiming they will work for everyone. However, if even one of the below works for you, surely that’s a positive result. Surely that means I deserve to be nominated for one of those writer’s awards or something. Ok, calm down, Stevie. Without further ado, let’s crack on with it.</p>

            <h2>Spend Time Doing Something You Love</h2>
            <p>It’s my contention that if we had less responsibilities and could spend our time doing what we loved, we’d live longer. I don’t know about you, but I don’t exactly get bored of the things I’m passionate about. Our hobbies bring warmth to our worlds as well as providing a stronger sense of self. They make us smile and, in many respects, contribute to a collective identity too. Hobbies are one of the best ways of making friends, something that everyone could benefit from.</p>
            <img src="pics/codAnx2-pexels-pixabay-260024.jpg" alt="picture by Pixabay" class="img-left">
            <p>When Python is being a prick, escaping to my hobby is one of the first things I do. Getting away from that infernal machine is exactly what is needed. Otherwise, I might throw my monitor off the balcony and potentially flatten a small dog. An hour on the guitar with my eyes closed and my PH levels are neutralised. My self-esteem is restored. I’m psyched up to joust with Javascript or battle with Bootstrap. I’m ready to rebel against React. Ok, I’m going too far now, but hopefully you catch my drift.</p>
            <p>My point is that escaping the mean machine for an hour to do something more relaxing can make a big difference. Funny thing is, I’ve only been coding for a few months, so I hope I’m not coming across as some know-it-all. I just don’t want to burn out because of coding anxiety. Therefore, I’ve picked my brain to unearth the things I consider most helpful. In addition, I suspect that coding will only get harder, especially when I land a job in tech. I’m gonna need these blogs for myself, let alone anyone else. That being said, if any of this stuff works for you, I’d thoroughly appreciate you reaching out to massage my ego.</p>
            <p>Whatever your hobby is, it’s a terrific way of stepping away from the pains of error messages. Given that coding involves staring at a screen, I would say that a hobby outside of computers is more ideal. However, that’s just my humble opinion; I can’t even remember the last time I played a computer game.</p>

            <h2>Coding Anxiety Can Be Killed With Cardio</h2>
            <p>I’ve been trying to develop a six-pack for years. I run 30 miles every week, more or less. My belly still resembles a balloon. That being said, after a six-mile run, I feel on top of the world. Any problems I had prior to hittin’ the legs are as good as crippled. Until I check my online banking at least. Coding anxiety hits me almost every day. Screwing around with Python’s gypsy hieroglyphs makes me want to jump off a bridge. Yet, a decent session of cardio sorts my head out and reinstills my sense of self-worth. It motivates me to continue working, even if it’s just small tasks like writing these blog posts.</p>
            <img src="pics/codAnx3-pexels-savvas-stavrinos-853247.jpg" alt="picture by Savvas Stavrinos" class="img-right">
            <p>Any doctor, nutritionist or fitness fanatic will rant on about the benefits of cardio until they’re blue in the face. I’m no health expert, but cardio has made a monumental improvement to my life. Physical fitness is just the beginning. Longevity, self-respect, motivation, determination and happiness are additional side-effects. I know some guys who prefer weightlifting. If that’s your thing, go for it!</p>

            <h2>Take a Breath…Take a Lot of Breaths Actually</h2>
            <p>Shortly after the pandemic went and pissed on everyone’s chips, I bought Wim Hof’s book, “Iceman”. It is with remorse that I can’t endorse him for his sense of lay terminology. Or maybe I’m just thick as pigshit. That being said, he’s inspired me to seek out new zones of discomfort. Wim Hof is known as the Iceman because his therapy revolves around exposure to the cold. He’s got a bunch of camps in Scandinavia, I think. Moreover, he frequently defies what we regard as physical norms; baffling the scientific community. The guy can bathe in a tub of ice water for hours; I dare say that would be fatal to anyone reading this.</p>
            <img src="pics/codAnx4-pexels-cottonbro-studio-3951373.jpg" alt="picture by Cottonbro from Pexels" class="img-left">
            <p>Before I finished his book, I was compelled to take cold showers almost every day. As the Hof suggests, it is excruciatingly uncomfortable at first. After all, we’ve got heating and hoodies and don’t need to be cold on purpose. Or do we? To begin with, I managed to submit myself to around one minute of Hof’s cruel battering sessions. It’s what I’d expect a stray dog to feel like on a miserable autumn day. Cold, wet and abused by life. Nevertheless, I soon grew to enjoy the torment. Try it. After a while, you find yourself giggling when you turn the water off. Completely refreshed and ready for battle with VS Code.</p>
            <p>Forget coding anxiety, cold showers are an impeccable counter for any kind of stress. It’s too damn chilly to focus on being worried about anything. Furthermore, once you’re done, feelings of alleviation and euphoria are more prominent than anything negative.</p>

            <h2>Coding Mentors or The Coding Community</h2>
            <p>This is one blessing I can count and that I’m delighted to have. A coding mentor. He comes as part of the program I’m enrolled on and removes some of the stress from coding. In my opinion, a decent mentor should be there to inspire and motivate you. To pick you up when you feel like quitting. Moreover, they should be reliable and should be able to simplify the stuff you’re learning.</p>
            <p>Coding anxiety was smothering me like a thick autumn fog the other day. I have one year to complete my traineeship and was overwhelmed with worry. I’m training to be a full-stack engineer and ‘full-stack is no joke’ according to an experienced developer I know. She is correct. This stuff is confusing and there’s an abundance of concepts to learn and memorise. Not to mention that I have to absorb at least the basics of nearly a dozen different languages.</p>
            <p>I contacted my coding mentor and we spoke on the phone for roughly 30 minutes. He provided excellent advice and alleviated a lot of the stress built up inside me. In general, I have as much access to his council as I feel necessary. However, I prefer to consult with him as a last resort.</p>
            <img src="pics/codAnx5-pexels-helena-lopes-1015568.jpg" alt="picture by Helena Lopes from Pexels" class="img-right">
            <p>By registering for a paid course of tuition, you may benefit from a dedicated mentor. However, not everyone has the funds to splash out on their education. I’ve been at rock-bottom both emotionally and financially and it sucks. Perhaps your life is currently fine, albeit, disposable income is depleted. If that’s the case, then I would recommend using social media to your advantage. LinkedIn is the best starting point in my opinion.</p>
            <p>I’m gonna go into more detail about this social media platform in another post, but it’s worth looking into. LinkedIn is the professional’s playground and offers a myriad of useful features. In addition, a lot of people in the tech sphere use Twitter, Elon Musk’s playground. One of its selling points is that tweets are limited to several hundred characters. This means you won’t be spending forever and a day concocting your posts. In a nutshell, I would describe Twitter as the social media for brainfarts. Pull something out your ass, slap it on Twitter, then crack on with your day!</p>
            <p>Regardless of the platform you choose for your mingling, you’ll soon discover the tech community is open and helpful. I wish I had more disposable funds at the moment because it would be amazing to fly across the world and meet some of the folk I’ve met. Many of the developers on these platforms have been doing this for years. Plus, they’re just as eager as you to meet others and build their own communities. By interacting with them and asking their advice, you're adding to their sense of value. I know an entire 20 things about programming, but it already feels terrific being able to share that knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Don’t Let Coding Anxiety Burn You Out</h2>
            <p>After staring at the screen for ten hours, it almost feels like your head is becoming a screen. Keeping up this pace non-stop for months at a time can’t be good for health. Whatever your line, working too much in any capacity is gonna take its toll on the senses.</p>
            <img src="pics/codAnx6-pexels-tara-winstead-8386558.jpg" alt="picture by Tara Winstead from Pexels" class="img-left">
            <p>I don’t know about you, but I’ve experienced burnout once or twice before. The first time it happened was in 2013 and upon its impact, I did nothing for an entire week. I suppose I was one of the lucky ones. I’ve read stories about people getting burned out and then losing their motivation altogether. Imagine that, putting an entire year - maybe more - into something, only for your efforts to become worthless due to burnout.</p>
            <p>I doubt success will come without going the extra mile. However, finding the right balance between work and play is crucial. A ten minute rest will recharge the batteries for another hour of the grind. Albeit, finding the strength for a solid week of hard graft requires a little more in my opinion.</p>

            <h2>Use Kindness to Battle Coding Anxiety</h2>
            <p>Not long ago, I read a book by David Hamilton called “The Five Side Effects of Kindness”. No prizes for guessing what it’s about, but I reckon it should be in everyone’s book collection. On my first day of secondary school, everyone was given a little, red, Gideon’s Bible. At the risk of sounding blasphemous, they should have flogged us Dr. Hamilton’s book instead. Obviously, reading is subjective; even the Holy books are a matter of taste and preference. However, a book that encourages you to be kind whilst simultaneously explaining the health benefits is a no-brainer.</p>
            <p>Supported by scientific evidence, Dr. Hamilton strengthens the jewels of information he drops. On top of that, there are suggestions on how you can practice kindness every few pages. He delves into the different chemicals that are released when we commit an act of kindness. For example, oxytocin.</p>
            <p>The book reiterates the general disposition and mentality of my wife. She’s got a super strong system of values and thoroughly believes in karma. Her actions are always positive and others can sense it from a mile away. People go out of their way to be around her for the positive energy she brings to any room. Plus, she’s an absolute chatterbox; her phone gets more attention than I do.</p>
            <p>In short, being kind to others - especially during stressful situations - instills feelings of warmth and happiness. That goes for both the recipient and ourselves. Doing this as second nature can reduce the risk of heart attacks and improve our quality of life in general. My intuition tells me David Hamilton knows what he’s talking about. Thus, I have been actively looking for opportunities to emit kindness. That alone feels great!</p>
