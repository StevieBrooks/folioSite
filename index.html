            <h1>Techtime: About Me<br> And About Time For Change</h1> 
            <img src="pics/meeee.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Greetings and salutations, I’m Steven Brooks and my computer doesn’t like me very much. I’ve decided to embrace some techtime as 
                I’ve been pondering a change of career for a while. I have worked as a copywriter since 2013 and have taught English since 2015. 
                The latter can be overwhelming and stressful, albeit, Javascript takes the biscuit, or cookie as it were. That being said, I love 
                being challenged and don’t throw in the towel easily.
            </p>
            <p>Coding is the most difficult thing I’ve ever tried to teach myself. Sometimes I feel like tying my shoelaces with no arms would be 
                easier. On the other hand, every day is a new adventure and a new opportunity to learn something. I am gaining strength with every 
                line I write and every connection I make in the tech sphere. Moreover, it’s only becoming more addictive.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to writing SEO friendly content and encouraging cheeky adolescents in the classroom, I have also worked as a DJ. Music is 
                my biggest passion in life. Furthermore, I hope to use my programming skills to change the music game someday. There are gaps in the 
                market and I would love to contribute.
            </p>
            <p>Problem solving runs in my family. My dad was an engineer and my sister has completed more puzzles than a stay-at-home mum. 
                On the other hand, I’m a lot more creative and this is one reason why I am striving for a career in development. I would like to 
                invite you to join me on this fascinating journey.</p>

             <!-- Use Google keyword planner, do research and find something SEO friendly -->
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>At the moment, I am trying to hone basic Javascript skills. As soon as I feel adequately equipped, 
                I have every intention of building projects and showcasing the best ones on here. Once I am at that 
                point, I will be updating my social media accordingly.

            <h2>I'll Be Blogging <br> About My Techtime Too!</h2>
            <p>Since childhood, the pen has been my most prominent weapon. I won the odd poetry competition, then wrote rap 
                songs as a teenager. A few years after leaving university, copywriting became my primary source of income. I 
                even wrote a book during the pandemic, but that was mostly as a coping mechanism and a means of killing time. 
                As soon as I discoverd the cost / profit ratio of self-publishing, becoming an author kinda lost its appeal.
            </p>
            <p>I plan to update this blog as often as I can spare the time. This is largely so I can monitor my growth as a 
                full-stack developer, but also because I enjoy playing with the written word. Indeed, the pen is mightier than 
                the sword. It writes laws and also writes obituaries. I do hope that you won't consider my command of the 
                written word too obnoxious as you read. On the contrary, it is my expressed wish that you glean some 
                entertainment from my blog. With that being said, please feel free to hit me with any comments or critiques.
            </p>
