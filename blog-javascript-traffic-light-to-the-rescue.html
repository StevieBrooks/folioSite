                <h1 class="main-title">Javascript Traffic Light to the Rescue…I Hope!</h1>
            </div>
            <p class="open-para">I am currently living in the mountains and the local traffic light system is a 
                disaster. Driving a motorbike around here is frivolous enough at the best of times. However, when the 
                other half is panic-stricken, her backseat driving shifts into second gear. An angry wife and a 
                horrendous road system are as harmonious as death metal in a retirement village. This has prompted 
                me to attempt a Javascript traffic light.
            </p>
            <p>I’ve been coding for roughly six months now so I suspect I'm on the verge of greatness. But back in 
                October, I wasn’t half as enlightened. How time flies. With my newfound knowledge of Javascript, I 
                was struggling to think of any projects to build. I’m a creative character, but felt depleted of 
                ideas or inspiration. My wife and I had been bitching about these traffic lights for months. As an 
                expert programmer, I was telling her that a few tweaks here and there would rectify the problem in 
                an hour or two. Then the idea hit me, I’ll do it myself.
            </p>
            <p>Now, I had no intention of going to the local authorities with my solution. I mean, who wants to 
                listen to someone with ten minutes of programming experience? Only someone with five, I presume.
                    That being said,  I was convinced I could create a more efficient system. Moreover, this  
                    brainwave  was the most interesting I'd had so far. Building a website with HTML and CSS is
                    one thing, but Javascript is a different animal. For two months, I couldn’t think of a damn 
                    thing to build. Now I was on the road - so to speak - to building my first real project.
            </p>
            <h2>Javascript Traffic Light From the Ground Up</h2>
            <p>The initial stage of my conquest was to create something static that at least resembled a traffic light.
                 No sweat. Red, orange - or amber if you’re the fussy type - and green circles. I’ll have them rolled 
                 out in a jiffy. I'm thrilled to tell you that my knowledge of border-radius remains intact. A splash 
                 of flexbox took care of aligning the lights in a vertical direction. Furthermore, I decided it was 
                 rude not to wrap them in some kind of container. Using a radial-gradient for the background, I was 
                 able to create a metallic effect.
            </p>
            <p>In a few years, I'll have a bash at recreating this contraption with a more 3D appearance. I’ve tried 
                concocting similar things before with CSS and it’s always a disaster. As soon as I resize the screen,
                 my window turns into Armageddon. Total meltdown. I need to hone my command of the position property. 
                 Anyway, I gave myself the green light to crack on with the programming. Incidentally, it's pertinent
                  to mention something here. It was only a few weeks ago that I felt overwhelmed by all this stuff. 
                  Bollocks to those copy-paste style training courses. For me, learning a few of the basics and then 
                  experimenting is more fruitful and satisfying.
            </p>
            <h2>Oh Bugger, Dead End…And Again…Piss!</h2>
            <p>Now that I had my groovy design sorted out, there was little reason to feel perplexed going forward. 
                I was under the impression that I could make everything else work inside an hour. Furthermore, I was 
                on a quest to revolutionise the local traffic game. What could have gone wrong? My javascript traffic 
                light was gonna win me citizenship. In all seriousness, I was adamant that I could create an entire
                 system of traffic lights.
            </p>
            <video src="vids/traffLights.mp4" class="vid-left" controls></video>
            <p>The nemesis that is my local intersection consists of five adjoining roads. Our light hits green and 
                we proceed in a northward direction. Seven seconds later, traffic to our right is allowed to slice into
                 our path. Luckily, I’ve never seen a major incident but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened before.
                  I hope the numpty who programmed such a retarded system has met his karma. I like to think he's been 
                  caught stealing gold in a middle-eastern country or something!
            </p>
            <p>I mean, building an entire Javascript traffic light system is beyond my capability. Fair enough. On 
                the other hand, I'm sure it’s not rocket science. And neither is basic physics for that matter.
 
                Lesson 5: Cruising Toyota Yaris + brainless traffic lights = broken leg!
                 
                Ok, now I’ve made my mark on science, I’ll cut to the chase. Getting a single Javascript traffic light 
                to function in the normal manner is not easy for an absolute beginner. At first, I thought that using a
                 bunch of setInterval() methods would do the trick. However, that resulted in something closer to disco
                  lighting rather than traffic lights.
            </p>
            <p>This coding frivolity continued for at least an hour while I played with loops and functions. At one point, 
                absolutely nothing would work, not even the basics. I tried to change the color of a light using the variable 
                that I had assigned it to. Even that command refused to cooperate. By this point, I was almost certain my 
                laptop was prejudiced against me. After 20 minutes of cursing and aggressive head scratching, I discovered 
                the live mode had stopped responding. I had no idea why, but all it did was feed my contempt for technology.
                 Someone should have programmed some endurance into VS Code.
            </p>
            <h2>Second Day, Second Gear</h2>
            <p>In all fairness, my text editor and browser are usually on their best behaviour.  During such peak times,
                 I’m jubilant that I can make anything happen at all. This manipulating-the-DOM lark makes me feel like 
                 a ten-year-old again. Actually, I would stretch to comparing Javascript success to a toddler on the 
                 verge of comprehending shapes. That innocent moment of triumph when they push their little cube through
                  the square hole. Although most of us can’t remember being that age, I doubt we were disappointed when
                   we learned something new. Then again, the realisation that I was too short to reach the biscuit tin
                    was traumatising.
            </p>
            <video src="vids/traffLights2.mp4" class="vid-right" controls></video>
            <p>Reverting back to my javascript traffic light fiasco, by day two, I was beaming. I had managed to stray away 
                from the concept of disco lights by this point. I used a combination of the new Date() and getSeconds()
                 methods with setInterval(). This resulted in the lights hopping from red to green and back again in an
                  almost-organised manner. However, they were suffering from an acute case of intermittency. For some reason, 
                  five seconds after the light returned to green, the red light flashed for a split second. This repeated 
                  infinitely and got worse if I hit the ‘push’ button. I tried to wrap my head around it but got next to
                   nowhere.
            </p>
            <p>After checking that live mode hadn’t died on me, I checked all my spellings and syntax. My go-to tactic when 
                I’m super confused is to systematically comment out every line of code one by one. This is clutching at straws,
                 I know. Albeit, I was once again convinced that my laptop had something against me.
            </p>
            <h2>Finally Nailed The Javascript Traffic Light…Kinda</h2>
            <p>By the third day of toying around, I’m delighted to say that I had created consistent functionality. My Javascript
                 traffic light was shifting from green to orange to red and back again. To an experienced programmer, I’m sure 
                 this would take mere minutes to achieve. It took me three days and I was still nowhere near finished. And that’s
                  “finished” as in a single working Javascript traffic light, never mind an entire system.
            </p>
            <p>Don’t get me wrong, I was over the moon with my efforts. All this experimenting and finally getting a result has made 
                me feel like a real programmer. However, now my head was tingling, I wanted more. On my first attempt at programming
                 my Javascript traffic light, I was considering the user experience. I’ve had an oversized “push” button from day 
                 one. But it was nothing short of a pain in the neck. Nevertheless, as I’d now programmed the autopilot side of 
                 things, I wanted the full package.
            </p>
            <video src="vids/traffLights3.mp4" class="vid-left" controls></video>
            <p>I honestly thought this would take forever, well, at least another few days of messing around. I reduced the duration 
                of the autopilot cycle to 45 seconds first. In addition, I reprogrammed the individual durations of the lights to 
                be more realistic. I mean, the orange light doesn’t stay lit for 20 whole seconds. However, the thing I’m most proud
                 of is making the light flash. In the function, I used a ternary statement and a modulus operator to take care of 
                 this. Proper chuffed!
            </p>
            <p>After a few attempts, I managed to sort out the user side of things and it works well enough. However, 
                I have found a flaw and I suppose it’s fair to call it a bug. Using the push button several times in 
                succession buggers up the routine. The light might go from green to orange and then return to green. 
                It depends at what intervals the “Push” button is pushed. This type of malfunction doesn’t even occur
                 at the infamous intersection that inspired me to build a Javascript traffic light. Luckily, these 
                 glitches don’t have a lasting effect; the lights continue on autopilot after a few seconds of carnage.
            </p>
            <h2>Go Johnny, Go Go Go!</h2>
            <p>The bottom line is: I doubt I’m going to be offered a job by city engineers anytime soon. Assigning me 
                the responsibility of Javascript traffic light developer will only lead to one outcome. More accidents
                 than the average Formula One race. That being said, it has been a wonderful and challenging experience.
            </p>
            <video src="vids/traffLightDone.mp4" class="vid-right" controls></video>
            <p>Working on this project has caused small amounts of stress only. I’ve just exaggerated the torment in 
                this post for ratings and shares, that’s all. The positives of committing to this project outweigh the
                 negatives ten fold. Even though my end result isn’t perfect, I still have something tangible for my
                  efforts. Moreover, I’m glad that flaws still exist in my Javascript traffic light. In the 
                  not-too-distant future, I will still have that heartwarming - and potentially dangerous - token 
                  of my coding infancy.
            </p>
            <p>I know that by health and safety standards, my project would be a giant flop. However, before 
                “completing” it, I wanted to add a few cheeky extras. This is because the tech community is 
                bombarded with the rhetoric that “your portfolio MUST stand out”. From a technical perspective,
                 I’m not there yet. Albeit, I feel strongly inclined to inject a small portion of my character into 
                 each project I roll out. I mean, there’s nothing special about a Javascript traffic light, unless you 
                 give it some life!
