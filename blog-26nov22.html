                <h2 class="main-title">Personal Tech Blog: Welcome To The Unconventional!</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="open-para">I am currently studying like one of the Essenes and I’m probably going to collapse after Christmas. That being said, 
                I’ve got every reason to be positive. Welcome to my personal tech blog. My little realm, my corner of the web. I’m 
                Steven Brooks and I am chasing the nerdiest profession on Earth: coding;
            </p>
            <p>This inaugural post won’t be focussing on tech that much. I’d just like to introduce myself. As someone in his mid-thirties, 
                I feel that I possess a few nuggets of wisdom worth sharing. Therefore, the first installment of my personal tech blog will 
                focus on five of the best decisions I’ve made in recent years.
            </p>
            <h2>Personal Tech Blog Writing On A Empty Stomach</h2>
            <img src="pics/1-pexels-roberto-vivancos-4796587.jpg" alt="" class="img-right"> 
            <p>It was September 10th, 2019, the day after my bezzie mate’s birthday. He was returning to Vietnam the following week and I had 
                no idea when I would see him next. I’m an introverted character and I’ve never been My Popular either. Truth be told, I’ve got 
                less friends than a police informant. Moreover, the notion of becoming a better human was on the agenda. I had been trying to 
                cultivate a healthier lifestyle for years.
            </p>
            <p>After a couple of weeks without alcohol, sleep is improved massively. Every night feels like you’re sleeping on a cloud. 
                After a month or two, motivation excels to a point that would rival Arnie in his hayday. I’m currently a 35-year old adolescent. 
                I spent well over a decade being continually pickled and blaming everyone else for it. Still, that type of mentality is my 
                dad’s fault!
            </p>
            <p>After nearly two years without a drink, I tried and failed at several things, mostly built on whims. I saw Greta Thunberg’s 
                powerful US speech and was inspired to capitalise in some way. Sounds vain I know, but as a child, I wrote a letter to Queen 
                Elizabeth expressing my concerns about the environment. I was only nine or ten and used the word “disgusted” a lot. It took 
                seven months to receive a reply…from her lady in waiting. I was told the old bag was “most delighted” to hear my views on
                 the countryside.
            </p>
            <p>Getting back to Greta’s speech. I had discovered dropshipping around that time and her words “right here, right now” were 
                resonating for all the wrong reasons. Unfortunately, one of my biggest motivations was money. I discovered soon enough that 
                such a drive is short-lived. As soon as you hit a tall enough obstacle, the adrenaline is siphoned out of you. Back to square one.
            </p>
            <img src="pics/2-pexels-brett-sayles-1213918.jpg" alt="" class="img-left">
            <p>Needless to say, I kept trying different things until I found something that kept hold of me. One of those things is the guitar. 
                If I won the lottery, I would embark on a journey of classical tuition. Addicted from the first chord, this soon developed into 
                another take-over-the-world endeavour. I convinced myself I was going to build a music magazine called Banter Shack. For the best 
                part of a year, I wrote as many articles as I could and contacted musicians for interviews. Albeit, this groundbreaking enterprise 
                had no real direction. I didn’t know if I wanted to be a blues magazine, DJ consortium, guitar blogger, or hip-hop hoarder.
            </p>
            <p>The difference with this project was that I was motivated by my first love in life; music. Even when I was feeling low, playing the 
                guitar for an hour got me back into the entrepreneurial zone. The grinding continued until I encountered a disaster. An installation 
                of some daft plugin caused my website to completely crash. Upon the advice of a WordPress tutor I hired, I backed up my data and 
                reinstalled WordPress. What he didn’t tell me was that I would have to upload all the content again manually. My friend said that 
                he would have thrown in the towel there and then. Contrary to his admirable work ethic, I plodded on through it; not exactly with a 
                beaming grin.
            </p>
            <p>A few months later, I decided to switch hosting platforms.  Naively, I thought it would be a simple process getting my website from 
                one to the other. For some daft reason, I consulted with the same WordPress tutor who I had relied on months before. I had survived 
                the house fire. Now I had doused myself in petrol to go rambling through a forest fire. To my surprise, it turned into a nightmare 
                and resulted in the stagnation of Banter Shack. Given that I have new ideas for the brand now, I am keeping hold of the domain name. 
                I’m addicted to the logo too.
            </p>
            <h2>Build A Personal Tech Blog</h2>
            <p>The temporary demise of Banter Shack put me into a hole for a week or so. I had put nearly a year of my life into it. All for it 
                to become as useful as a feather duster on the battlefield. I felt like Samson after a day at the barbers, followed by a 
                swift boot in the bollocks from Delila.
            </p>
            <img src="pics/3-pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3771091.jpg" alt="" class="img-right">
            <p>Low as I was, the fire burning inside me propelled me back towards the swivel chair. I hit the internet in search of a better life. 
                Taking these chances that had led nowhere had finally taken its toll. The thought of being a drunk loser with no real talent for 
                the rest of my days was killing me. That being said, I reckon most entrepreneurs would submit that the route to success is 
                bombarded with failures. I'm sure this personal tech blog will also encounter some bumps and bruises.
            </p>
            <p>As luck would have it, I stumbled across a reputable training course that offered a job guarantee upon completion. Starting salary 
                of between £25k and £40k per year. I’ll bite, and I realise that I’m contradicting myself a little here. Chasing money and so on. 
                Except with this, I am simply chasing stability and security, especially that I’m now married. Moreover, coding offers an 
                abundance of other  benefits. And I’m not even talking about the material ones. This is hardly an original notion, but it makes
                 me feel like I’m developing a superpower. Until Lex Luthor comes along with more outlandish syntax.
            </p>
            <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve been acclimated to all manner of creative brainwaves. In a few more years, I might just be able 
                to bring some of them to life. As I’ve previously mentioned, my recent ventures have kinda failed. This is largely due to my lack 
                of technical skills but there’s more to it. Patience has never been one of my virtues. However, this is something that learning 
                to code is teaching me to cultivate. I’ve even started playing chess again.
            </p>
            <p>I’m more talkative than I’ve been for years, albeit from behind a keyboard. Nevertheless, I sincerely hope to meet some of the 
                folk I’ve been mingling with on social media. I’ve been frequenting Twitter mostly, but I’m gradually learning that each platform
                 has its place. LinkedIn for its formalities, Discogs for the luxury of real-time communiques, and so on.
            </p>
            <img src="pics/4-pexels-uzunov-rostislav-5269530.jpg" alt="" class="img-left">
            <p>I would love to witness one of my brainfarts come to life one day. If it paid the bills and bought me a sleek, yellow, Lambo, that
                 would be a massive bonus. Above all, the thought of something I’ve invented making a difference to society fills me with bubbles.
                  It contaminates me with excitement and gives me the stamina to propel forward. Perhaps one day, I’ll have billions in disposable
                   income to sway politics in my favour. Crude ambitions aside, my short-term dream is simply to buy nice food without worrying about 
                   the price.
            </p>
            <h2>I Retired From Teaching To Become Steve Jobless</h2>
            <p>Life after university was a downhill ride to the lowest point I’ve ever been. The only things I had to look forward to were a wank
                 and my bi-weekly dole payment. One day, a friend and I were getting hammered on a cocktail of cheap cider and prescription 
                 drugs. We were interviewing each other on tape and forgot to turn off the machine. After an hour of talking rubbish, I broke 
                 down into a dismal suicide confession. And it was all captured on tape. For years I’ve regretted denying my friend’s offer to 
                 keep the infernal thing; it would have come in handy for loads of my whimsical projects.
            </p>
            <p>Less than a year later, I managed to do something I had never been remotely capable of. I  successfully saved over two grand. 
                Until that point, trust-fund babies would have had a higher aptitude for money management. I'd always withdrawn my cash faster than lions chasing
                 gazelles. Good thing I'm onto a personal tech blog rather than anything related to finance.
            </p>
            <img src="pics/5-pexels-pixabay-372748.jpg" alt="" class="img-right">
            <p>After nearly 3 years of delinquency, I finally landed a freelance copywriting role. As fate would have it, a friend turned me onto the 
                idea of travelling to Thailand. His idea was simple, he wanted to venture out there for three weeks, “get a Thai bride and go
                 back to bang her every now and then”. The guy was a player, but I think he underestimated marital proceedings abroad. I put the 
                 idea past another friend - the one who loved prescription drugs - and within days, we had planned to leave the UK forever. To 
                 this day, the only thing I miss is the NHS.
            </p>
            <p>While it would take a few more years to really cultivate discipline, this was a tremendous start. For the first time ever, magma
                 was flinging me out of bed by 8am. My fingers were becoming iron sausages. I was a keyboard cheetah. Not bad for someone who 
                 used to have a cat in hell’s chance of going anywhere in life. Yes, according to my high-school English teacher, I would always 
                 be a loser. Until this point, she was completely right. I fumbled university, but now I was on a one way trip to the right side
                  of destiny.
            </p>
            <p>Cutting to the chase, I continued writing bollocks I didn’t care about for a few years. Then I got into teaching English in Vietnam.
                 The irony of this has always amused me and that novelty probably lasted for about a year. I shifted to working online exclusively
                  which was great at first. Living in Southeast Asia, making a low-end British income, working when I pleased. However, this novelty 
                  lost its touch after a few years too. Neither writing or teaching has led to advancement, but I assume full responsibility. I’ve 
                  never been passionate about copywriting or teaching English; they were a means to an end.
            </p>
            <p>The small amount of savings I’ve accumulated over the last few years has allowed me to take chances. Quitting my job entirely is the
                 biggest to date. I am currently springing out of bed at 5.30 am to pursue this new and exciting career path. I spend 8 hours a day
                  studying and practicing coding. In addition, I try to dedicate an hour or two to this personal tech blog.
            </p>
            <h2>Tie The Knot With My Angel</h2>
            <img src="pics/6-pexels-jasmine-carter-888899.jpg" alt="" class="img-left">
            <p>My wife and I joke occasionally that I only married her for the visa exemption and the luxuries that affords. I’ll even write a 
                witty song about the notion when I’m better at the guitar. Truth be told, tying the knot with my angelic better half is one of
                 the best decisions I’ll ever make. Her constant bitching forces me out of my comfort zone all the time. I’m cultivating more 
                 patience than I ever knew I was capable of. Furthermore, I am blossoming in the fine art of keeping my emotions locked in a 
                 cage. When the wife asks me what’s wrong, my response is that “I’m sound”. What goes unmentioned is that I could happily punch 
                 an innocent goat in the mouth!
            </p>
            <p>We met in 2015 when I was still a heavy drinker and she was more innocent than most 4-year olds. After two weeks of being with her,
                 I was convinced it wasn’t working and said I was going back to Hanoi. I let her come to terms with things whilst I went out to DJ 
                 in a local bar. By the time I got back, I was less than sober and she had spontaneously quit her job and booked a flight to Hanoi 
                 too. Seeing the excitement on her face; I didn’t have the heart to refuse her the opportunity to see her own capital city.
            </p>
            <p>Our relationship was never easy; in fact, many would have described it as toxic. I’ve always told her - when we’re mates - that I accept 
                99% of the responsibility. On the other hand, since meeting Lily, I have made a conscious effort to better myself. I practice inner 
                peace and all that crap. Running is one of my top priorities and I’m constantly striving to cultivate emotional strength. Lily is a 
                terrific help…sometimes.
            </p>
            <h2>Sever Ties With Past Acquaintances</h2>
            <p>A few weeks ago, I permanently deleted my Facebook account. No big deal considering most of my ‘friends’ couldn’t even speak 
                English beyond a simple ‘hello’. The majority of ones who are fluent in my mother tongue, I wouldn’t recognise in a well-lit 
                room. When I lived in Hanoi, I suppose I was a regular at a few bars. A spontaneous laugh with some footloose backpacker would 
                result in the inevitable friend request. If either party was feeling generous, it could even lead to a message. Then after that,
                 they became another statistic on my profile.
            </p>
            <p>The small number of mates I have kept in touch with over the years are either party animals or generally unreliable. Or both. 
                I confess that my judge of character between ages 11 and 30 has been less than adequate. That being said, severely reducing my 
                alcohol intake has given me a fresh perspective on life. Nowadays, I value things like decency, hard work, compassion and 
                creativity.
            </p>
            <p>I now understand the notion of self-respect and with that in mind, have severed friendships with those whom I don’t consider 
                high value. I’ve got less acquaintances than Elizabeth Fritzl had during her adolescence. My wife is my diamond, my angel,
                 my rescuer, and my best friend.
            </p>
            <img src="pics/7-pexels-jonathan-cooper-14330407.jpg" alt="" class="img-right">
            <p>I used to enjoy sweaty basement clubs and the blessing of house music. Part of that culture involves talking complete and utter 
                rubbish between DJ sets. I still keep in touch with one of the guys I used to go clubbing with. However, he is also the 
                unreliable type and he admits it.
            </p>
            <p>Being reliable isn’t everything of course, but I consider it a bi-product of a quality individual. If there are people you 
                can depend on, the standard of life is improved. Currently, my wife is depending on me to buy a car so she feels safer when 
                we venture more than ten feet from the house. The earache I receive for not providing such a luxury yet…
            </p>
            <h2>And that’s that</h2>
            <p>This is my first blog and I hope it wasn’t too ridiculous. I’m quite certain that as my website grows, so will my aptitude 
                for embarrassing myself. On the other hand, I do feel truly blessed and rewarded when I produce something that is valuable to 
                others. Besides, one can’t spend 10 hours a day locked in front of their computer without picking up something useful. With
                 that in mind, part of this blogging adventure will include dropping any nuggets of wisdom that I reckon you will benefit from.
                  I hope to enthrall you again when I drop my next post. Until then, stay safe, and don’t trust those damn spambots for a second!
